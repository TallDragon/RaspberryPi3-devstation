# My Raspberry Pi 3 Development Workstation

Inspired by the book [Exploring the Raspberry Pi 2 with C++, *by Warren Gay*](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484217382) we decided to innovate our own adventure in the world of the Raspberry. Basicly because the book was expensive and outdated, no offense Warren. And it took refactoring to get this 2015 book up and running.

Don't expect a replacement of the book, if you want to understand in depth please be a charm and buy the book. We are just updating to 2019. *And probably this is outdated soon too ;)*

Difference with the book:
- we started with the Raspberry Pi 3B+
- Extended the rpi with microsoft cooling, our first one burned to death
- Add info to be able to use gtkwave, we missed this in the book
- Kernel building does not need mkknlimg anymore and has some tweeks

Feel free to comment on things.
